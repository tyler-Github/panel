Default username/password is admin/admin for the control panel.  It's suggested you change this password asap.

If you get an error the first time you access the web panel about not having access to the ASP.Net Temporary directory, wait about 20 seconds and hit refresh.  This problem tends to fix itself and should not occur again.

Although a license is no longer required, you'll need a license to enable the advanced features of the panel.  There should be a file with an extension of  .licr and/or .licrm in the <install location>\logs folder, this is the license request file.  If you have an account for the license portal area of our site, www.brainless.us, you'll be able to generate a license with this file.  You'll need to of either purchased a license to access the portal, or requested a demo account.  Feel free to contact us for a demo license.

If you specified port 80, entering http://localhost should allow you to access the control panel.  If you specified something other than 80, you can access the control panel by going to http://localhost:<port>, ie http://localhost:8080.
