uget allows you to make API calls to the panel from the commandline.  This is useful for making api calls in batch/shell scripts.

On linux run by calling mono.  I.e:  mono uget.exe

The panel's API info is available at:  http://www.brainless.us/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=244

Commandline syntax:
uget <url> <username> <password> <id> <command> <option 1> <option 2>

Where
<url> = the base url to your control panel.  i.e. https://demo.brainless.us
<username> = panel username
<password> = panel password
<id> = ID of the item (could be user/server/extra ID) the command should be ran against
<command> = the API Command
<option 1> = option data for API call
<option 2> = option data for API call

uget will return a non zero number if there is an error.
Return Codes:
0 = OK
1 = Missing commandline arguments
2 = Panel is offline or invalid username/password
3 = The panel returned an error when executing the API command.
